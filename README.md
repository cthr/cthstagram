this is extremely experimental. what you're about to do is upload an
image to the cheapEth blockchain. the image you select is broken up into chunks
and then pushed in individual transactions, this is to avoid the block gas limit (8,000,000)
each transaction will contain roughly 10kb (5994383 gas) and use up ~75% of the block space
